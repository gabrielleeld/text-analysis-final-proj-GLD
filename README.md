##Final Project for Intro. to Text Analysis: Examining Reviews of Cover Music

I use review data by expert evaluators to examine differences in assessments of cover music between two groups of musicians. To this end, I use tf-idf with scikit learn to calculate and visualize differences in the terms used by the expert evaluators to describe cover songs by both types of musicians. This work contributes to an ongoing research project about how perceptions of reusing ideas can impact creative outputs. My results suggest that there are some differences in the terms used in reviews, and that (as predicted) one group of musicians is more likley to be described as creative than the other group.
